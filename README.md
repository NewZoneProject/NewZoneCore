# NewZoneCore

NewZoneCore is the foundational kernel of the NewZone ecosystem — a minimal, autonomous, cryptographically anchored core designed to run entirely on a personal device. It establishes the root-of-trust, identity, and internal structure of a self-sovereign distributed node.

This project defines the essential components required for a NewZone node to exist as an independent digital entity. It provides the secure foundation upon which higher-level services, applications, and user interfaces can be built.

NewZoneCore focuses on:

- establishing a master cryptographic identity for the node  
- deriving and managing per-service keys  
- maintaining a local trust model independent of external systems  
- supervising and coordinating internal services  
- providing a stable environment for distributed applications  
- enabling full autonomy on mobile and personal devices  

The goal of NewZoneCore is to create a reliable, minimal, and secure base layer that empowers users to operate their own distributed infrastructure — without servers, without third parties, and without external dependencies.

This repository contains the early structure of the core. Additional components, services, and integrations will evolve around it as the NewZone platform grows.
