# NewZoneCore — Core Concept

## Purpose
NewZoneCore is a **personal autonomous Root of Trust**.
It represents the user as a cryptographic entity and guarantees identity and origin — not behavior.

## Core Principles
- Offline-first
- User sovereignty
- No centralized authority
- No runtime data mediation
- Cryptographic truth over network truth

## What the Core Is
- Personal digital passport
- Root key holder
- Trust and identity anchor
- Cryptographic notary

## What the Core Is NOT
- Message router
- Runtime orchestrator
- Microservice manager
- Network proxy
- Global truth provider

## Fundamental Rule
The Core participates in the **birth of trust**, not in its daily life.
